                Hello all, thanks for checking out my Portfolio. I'm Leah, and I am here to show off my work as a new Web developer. 
                I just finished up a bootcamp learning HTML, CSS, Python, Flask, and some JavaScript. My hope is that I can start doing
                freelance work and help others create beautiful websites. I've been doing lots of research on hosting and all that comes
                with freelancing. What I want to offer and what I think I am capable of doing. 
        
                I'm learning and trying new things every day. So if you are here and are looking for a website created, go to my 
                home tab and send me an email, and I'll get back to you.
        
                My passion project right now is my DnD notes site, where folks who love DnD and are the note takers can have a free place
                to do so and add some other fun features to it.
            </p>
